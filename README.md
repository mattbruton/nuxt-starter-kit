## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at https://localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack
We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).

## PassportJS JWT

Coming soon...
